# AH Psychoanalyst

## Overview
AH Psychoanalyst is a software engineering project designed to provide comprehensive mental health resources through an accessible web platform. This project focuses on addressing the stigma and lack of accessibility surrounding mental health care, especially in Pakistan. By leveraging technology, we aim to make therapy sessions, consultations, and mental health assessments just a few clicks away.

## Features

- **Complaint System**: Raise issues about therapists or treatments.

## Technology
This project uses the **Waterfall Model** for its initial development phase. However, recognizing the benefits of flexibility, adaptability, and continuous feedback, future enhancements and iterations of this project will adopt the **Agile Methodology**. Agile will enable:
- Faster response to changing requirements.
- Regular feedback and involvement from stakeholders.
- Incremental delivery of features for quicker user adoption.

### Functional Requirements

## Why AH Psychoanalyst?
Mental health is a critical yet neglected area, especially in Pakistan, where there are only **0.19 psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants**. AH Psychoanalyst bridges this gap by offering an anonymous, accessible, and comprehensive solution to mental health care.

## Future Vision: Agile Methodology
Our future development will follow **Agile Methodology**, ensuring:
- Better alignment with user needs through continuous feedback.
